## Design patterns with Ruby
 Software design pattern's have been around for a long time but it was made popular in 1994 when the book Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software was first published. The book also is frequently referred as the GoF (Gang of four book). Essentially design patterns are proven ways to write your code to solve problems that occur over and over again. People have discovered them with experience over the years. It taken time an experience to detect whether a problem is suited for a particular pattern.
